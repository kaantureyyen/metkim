## RADCOMM Radiation Detection Systems

### Vehicle Systems/RC1000-RC2000-RC4000

The RC1000 series of radiation detection systems have been designed for lower density materials such as waste and light/bulky scrap metal. The vehicle size and type will help determine the appropriate detector panel size (34L or 69L). The RC1000 detection systems all utilize RadComm’s high quality specially prepare Polyvinyl Toluene (PVT) scintillators.  The proprietary PVT design has been optimized to allow maximum light output during scintillation events.

The RC2000 series of radiation detection systems have been designed for moderate density materials such as compressed waste and processed scrap metal.The vehicle size and type will help determine the appropriate detector panel size (69L, 91L, 138L) and conﬁguration. The RC2000 detection systems all utilize RadComm’s high quality specially prepared Polyvinyl Toluene (PVT) scintillators, electronics and Photomultiplier Tube (PMT).

The RC4000 series of radiation detection systems have been designed to detect very low Gamma Ray emissions in high density materials. The vehicle size and type will help determine the appropriate panel size and configuration. The RC4000 is supplied in three detector panel sizes (69L, 91L, 138L) with any configuration with up to 8 detector panels. The RC4000 detection systems all utilize RadComm’s high quality specially prepare Polyvinyl Toluene (PVT) scintillators, electronics and Dual Photomultiplier Tubes (PMT´s).

### Portables/RC2-RC22-RC23-Syclone-RHandy

The RC2 has been designed to operate in the harshest of environments without sacrificing reliability. With an all metal construction and sealed components it can take most anything including accidental impacts and everyday dirt. The RC2 has been designed to detect very low radiation intensity level from radioactive materials even when hidden by scrap metal. It is an extremely effective handheld detector that utilizes a large internal, high grade PVT, plastic scintillation detector to maximize sensitivity.

### Cricket  Technology

The CRICKET radiation detection system is designed specifically to meet the needs of the scrap, steel, and waste industries. The CRICKET’s revolutionary yet simple design provides an optimum level of detection capability for low intensity radioactive sources, on a continuous basis, in applications where radiation detection systems never existed before. The level of detection capability will far exceed any conventional radiation detection system, including detection systems that are mounted on the boom of a crane, regardless of detector size.
